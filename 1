# APM Sprint Planning Under Competing Priorities

This project is a case study demonstrating how an Associate Product Manager (APM) plans a one-month sprint while managing multiple client priorities with limited engineering resources.

## Problem Statement
The product team consists of 10 developers working across multiple hospital products. Due to internal constraints such as exams and partial leaves, full team capacity is not available.

The goal is to design a realistic sprint plan that:
- Prioritizes work across clients
- Allocates resources effectively
- Clearly defines trade-offs
- Maintains transparent communication

## Clients Involved
- Hospital A (Existing client – urgent OPD changes)
- Hospital B (New high-revenue client – HR module)
- Hospital C (Near closure – inventory features)

## Key Deliverables
- Sprint roadmap
- Visual sprint plan
- Decision justification
- Communication strategy

This project reflects real-world product management decision-making.
