# APM Sprint Planning Under Competing Priorities

This project is a case study demonstrating how an Associate Product Manager (APM) plans a one-month sprint while managing multiple client priorities with limited engineering resources.

## Problem Statement
The product team consists of 10 developers working across multiple hospital products. Due to internal constraints such as exams and partial leaves, full team capacity is not available.

The goal is to design a realistic sprint plan that:
- Prioritizes work across clients
- Allocates resources effectively
- Clearly defines trade-offs
- Maintains transparent communication

## Clients Involved
- Hospital A (Existing client – urgent OPD changes)
- Hospital B (New high-revenue client – HR module)
- Hospital C (Near closure – inventory features)

## Key Deliverables
- Sprint roadmap
- Visual sprint plan
- Decision justification
- Communication strategy

This project reflects real-world product management decision-making.




## Problem Overview

The objective is to manage competing priorities from three hospital clients within a one-month sprint.

Constraints include:
- Limited developer availability
- High urgency for an existing client
- Revenue impact from a new client
- Deal-closure dependency for another client

The challenge is to balance urgency, business impact, and team capacity.






## Prioritization Logic

| Hospital | Priority | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Hospital A | High | Existing client with urgent operational need |
| Hospital B | Medium | New client with high revenue potential |
| Hospital C | Low | Important but less time-sensitive |

### Decision Framework
- Customer trust and urgency first
- Revenue impact second
- Future opportunity third






## Sprint Roadmap

### Team Capacity
- Total developers: 10
- Partial leave: 2
- Exam constraints: Reduced availability
- Effective capacity planned: 7 developers

### Week-wise Plan

| Week | Hospital | Task | Developers |
|-----|---------|------|-----------|
| Week 1 | Hospital A | OPD layout changes | 3 |
| Week 2 | Hospital A | Testing & deployment | 2 |
| Week 1–2 | Hospital B | HR module setup | 2 |
| Week 3–4 | Hospital B | Core HR features | 3 |
| Week 3–4 | Hospital C | Basic inventory features | 2 |












## Trade-offs and Assumptions

- Advanced inventory features for Hospital C are deferred
- Payroll and advanced HR features for Hospital B are postponed
- No internal feature development this sprint

These trade-offs help avoid over-commitment and ensure quality delivery.








## Communication Strategy

### Internal Team
- Daily stand-ups (15 minutes)
- Weekly sprint reviews
- Clear ownership of tasks

### Clients
- Hospital A: Frequent updates due to urgency
- Hospital B: Weekly demos
- Hospital C: Timeline clarity and expectation management








## Conclusion

This sprint plan demonstrates realistic product management by balancing urgency, revenue impact, and team capacity.

By clearly prioritizing work, defining trade-offs, and maintaining transparent communication, the sprint ensures maximum business impact within constraints.
